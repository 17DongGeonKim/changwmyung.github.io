I'm Chang Woo Myung, an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry at Chungnam National University. 

Before joining the faculty, I worked as a postdoc researcher at University of Cambridge with Prof. Angelos Michaelides and at ETH Zurich/USI with Prof. Michele Parrinello. I received my PhD in Chemistry under Prof. Kwang S. Kim at UNIST, Korea. Before that, I recieved my MS and BS at POSTECH, Korea. 

Our group's interests lie at developing machine learning methods for understanding complex chemical processes in materials and surfaces. We develop [machine learning potential](https://github.com/amirhajibabaei/AutoForce) algorithms using sparse Gaussian process regression. Also we study the structure of complex surface by developing machine learning methods for global optimization algorithms. More information on my research is available in [research projects](prjects/).

The group is currently looking for talented Master, PhD students and postdocs. If you have a background in chemistry, physics and materials science and the above projects seem interesting, feel free to contact me.
