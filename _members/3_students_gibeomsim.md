      I’m Gi Beom Sim and master’s degree candidate in computational chemistry.<br>
      I'm studying the electrochemical catalyst combining chemistry with computing technology.<br>
      Recently, greenhouse gas emission problem and methodology of calculation is my interest.<br>
      I'd like to devote fundamentally solution of these issues with advanced development of catalyst and understanding the chemical problems involved.<br>

According to the flow, my research goals are as below.

1. Development of sparse gaussian process regression(SGPR)-based global optimization method.
2. Study of catalytic reaction mechanism at the first-principle level and develop the algorithms for this research.
3. Development of bayesian basin hopping algorithms based on SGPR.
4. Development of empirical potential guided SGPR.
