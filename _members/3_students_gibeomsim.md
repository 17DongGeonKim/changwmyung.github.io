I’m Gi Beom Sim and master’s degree cadidate in computational chemistry.
I'm studying the electrochemical catalyst combining chemistry with computing technology.
Recently, the fundamental part of the global environment problem and methodology of calculation is my interest.
I'd like to devote fundamentally solving environmental issues, and understanding the chemical problems involved.

According to the flow, my research goals are as below.

1. Development of sparse gaussian process regression(SGPR)-based global optimization method.
2. Study of catalytic reaction mechanism at the first-principle level and develop the algorithms for this research.
3. Development of bayesian basin hopping algorithms based on SGPR.
4. Development of empirical potential guided SGPR.
