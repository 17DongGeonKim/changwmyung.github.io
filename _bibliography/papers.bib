  title = {Al-doping driven suppression of capacity and voltage fadings in 4d-element containing Li-ion-battery cathode materials: machine learning and density functional theory},
  journal = {Advanced Energy Materials},
  Abstract={The anion redox reaction in high-energy-density cathode materials such as Li-excess layered oxides suffers from voltage/capacity fadings due to irreversible structural instability. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) along with the fast simulations using the universal potential/forces generated from our newly developed sparse Gaussian process regression (SGPR) machine learning (ML) method, we investigated the very complicated/complex structures, XANES spectra, redox phenomena and Li diffusion of these battery materials depending on charging/discharging processes. We found that voltage/capacity fadings are strongly suppressed in 4d-element-containing cathode by Al-doping. The suppressed fadings are discussed in view of the structural and electronic changes depending on charged/discharged states which are reflected in their EXAFS and XANES spectra. According to crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP) and Bader charge analyses of Li1.22Ru0.61Ni0.11Al0.06O2 (Al-LRNO), the Al-doping helps in forming Ni-Al bonding and hence strengthens the bonding-orbital characteristics in Al-O bonds. This strengthened Al-O bonding hinders oxygen oxidation and thus enhances structural stability, diminishing safety concerns. The Al-doping driven suppression of capacity fading and voltage decay would help in designing stable reversible layered cathode materials.},

  title = {Challenges and Opportunities in Metal Halide Perovskites from Machine Learning Perspectives},
  journal = {arXiv},
  Abstract={Metal halide perovskite (MHP) is a promising next generation energy material for numerous applications, such as solar
cell, light emitting diode, laser, sensor, transistors and more. MHPs show excellent mechanical, dielectric, photovoltaic,
photoluminescence, electronic properties that provide ideal platform for various device applications, and such intrigu-
ing physical and chemical properties draw many attentions from theory as well. Unfortunately, however, there exists a
chasm between the continuing experimental success of MHPs and theoretical understanding because of its disordered
structures, compositions, solution-based synthesis routes, ionic interactions and non-adiabatic effects. As these chal-
lenges have become major bottlenecks against further development and application of MHPs, it is timely to consider
fresh perspectives to circumvent these challenges. In this regard, machine learning (ML) approaches showed a great
promise to overcome many challenges and bottlenecks in many fields of science. In this Perspective, we overview some
of experimental challenges in MHPs that require detailed theoretical insights and understanding. We propose some
of promising ML schemes, including ab initio ML potentials, materials design tools, natural language process (NLP)
models, and data mining strategies. Possible roles and pipelines of ML frameworks are highlighted that could close the
gap between experiment and theory and could establish systematic MHPs research directions in future},

  title = {Tracking single atoms in a liquid environment},
  Journal = {Nature},
  Abstract={The chemical behaviour of single metal atoms largely depends on the local coordination environment, including interactions with the substrate and with the surrounding gas or liquid. However, the key instrumentation for studying such systems at the atomic scale generally requires high vacuum conditions, limiting the degree to which the aforementioned environmental parameters can be investigated. Here we develop a new platform for transmission electron microscopy investigation of single metal atoms in liquids and study the dynamic behaviour of individual platinum atoms on the surface of a single layer MoS2 crystal in water. To achieve the record single atom resolution, we introduce a double liquid cell based on a 2D material heterostructure, which allows us to submerge an atomically thin membrane with liquid on both sides while maintaining the total specimen thickness of only ~ 70 nm. By comparison with an identical specimen imaged under high vacuum conditions, we reveal drastic differences in the single atom resting sites and atomic hopping behaviour, demonstrating that in situ imaging conditions are essential to gain complete understanding of the chemical activity of individual atoms. These findings pave the way for in situ liquid imaging of chemical processes with single atom precision.},

To elucidate the interface dynamics and its impact on the electron transfer process, we have studied the interfacial features of a TiO2/MAPbI3 system. First principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that the rotational freedom of MA present within the bulk is considerably suppressed due to interaction of MA with the TiO2 substrate, highlighting orientationally ordered MA at the interface. The optimized interface structure shows the C--N axis of MA titled towards the TiO2 surface so as to maximize the interaction between N-attached H and underlying O. The very short O⋯H⋯N distance with very large hydrogen bonding energy identifies short strong hydrogen bonding (SSHB) as the origin of structural re-organization at the interface. As for the electronic structure, this proton sharing between MA and TiO2 has a critical impact on the energy level alignment at the interface, thus driving the electron transfer process from MA to TiO2. Indeed, significant reduction in the electron transfer barrier is observed for the energetically optimal interface configuration which promotes the electron transfer across the interface and photovoltaic properties.},

We demonstrate that the adsorption of FGr on MAPbI3 results in the formation of a stable interface with appreciable binding energy (∼0.4 eV per Pb atom). Thorough assessment of energy-level alignment indicates that the FGr/MAPbI3 interface has desirable properties with regard to the electron transfer (hole blockage) process. These results underscore the potential of using FGr as an interlayer for electron transport between a perovskite layer and an electron transfer medium (such as TiO2) as well as a moisture blocker for achieving high perovskite stability by perfect waterproofing.

Here we show that PbI2/AI-terminated lead iodide perovskite (APbI3; A = Cs+/ methylammonium (MA)) interfaced with the charge transport medium of graphene or TiO2 exhibits a sizable/robust Rashba--Dresselhaus (RD) effect using density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations above the cubic-phase temperature. At the PbI2-terminated graphene/CsPbI3(001) interface, ferroelectric distortion toward graphene facilitates an inversion breaking field. At the MAI-terminated TiO2/MAPbI3(001) interface, the enrooted alignment of MA+ toward TiO2 by short-strong hydrogen bonding and concomitant PbI3 distortion preserve the RD interactions even above 330 K. The robust RD effect at the interface even at high temperatures, unlike in bulk, changes the direct-type band to indirect-type to suppress recombination of the electron and hole, thereby letting these accumulated carriers overcome the potential barrier between perovskite and charge transfer materials, which promotes the solar cell efficiency.},

Here we show that PbI2/AI-terminated lead iodide perovskite (APbI3; A = Cs+/ methylammonium (MA)) interfaced with the charge transport medium of graphene or TiO2 exhibits a sizable/robust Rashba--Dresselhaus (RD) effect using density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations above the cubic-phase temperature. At the PbI2-terminated graphene/CsPbI3(001) interface, ferroelectric distortion toward graphene facilitates an inversion breaking field. At the MAI-terminated TiO2/MAPbI3(001) interface, the enrooted alignment of MA+ toward TiO2 by short-strong hydrogen bonding and concomitant PbI3 distortion preserve the RD interactions even above 330 K. The robust RD effect at the interface even at high temperatures, unlike in bulk, changes the direct-type band to indirect-type to suppress recombination of the electron and hole, thereby letting these accumulated carriers overcome the potential barrier between perovskite and charge transfer materials, which promotes the solar cell efficiency.},

Therefore, it is desirable to design catalysts that only require minimal amounts of Pt to function, but that are still highly active. Here we report hydrogen production in acidic water using a multicomponent catalyst with an ultralow Pt loading (1.4 μg per electrode area (cm2)) supported on melamine-derived graphitic tubes (GTs) that encapsulate a FeCo alloy and have Cu deposited on the inside tube walls. With a 1/80th Pt loading of a commercial 20{\%} Pt/C catalyst, in 0.5 M H2SO4 the catalyst achieves a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 18 mV, and shows a turnover frequency of 7.22 s−1 (96 times higher than that of the Pt/C catalyst) and long-term durability (10,000 cycles). We propose that a synergistic effect between the Pt clusters and single Pt atoms embedded in the GTs enhances the catalytic activity.},

Currently, state-of-the-art electrocatalysts of Pt and IrO2/RuO2 exhibit the benchmark catalytic activity toward HER and OER, respectively. However, expanding their practical application is hindered by their exorbitant price and scarcity. Therefore, the development of alternative effective electrocatalysts for water splitting is crucial. In the last few decades, substantial effort has been devoted to the development of alternative HER/OER and water splitting catalysts based on various transition metals (including Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, and atomic Pt) which show promising catalytic activities and durability. In this review, after a brief introduction and basic mechanism of HER/OER, the authors systematically discuss the recent progress in design, synthesis, and application of single atom and cluster-based HER/OER and water splitting catalysts. Moreover, the crucial factors that can tune the activity of catalysts toward HER/OER and water splitting such as morphology, crystal defects, hybridization of metals with nonmetals, heteroatom doping, alloying, and formation of metals inside graphitic layered materials are discussed. Finally, the existing challenges and future perspectives for improving the performance of electrocatalysts for water splitting are addressed.},

The remarkable HER performance is attributed to the near-zero free energies for hydrogen adsorption/desorption on Ru(SAs) and the increased conductivity of melamine-derived GN sheets by the presence of nitrided-Ru(NPs). The nitridation process forming nitrided-Ru(NPs), which are imperfectly covered by a GN shell, allows superb long-term operation durability.

Thus, how to boost the performance of ETL is of utmost importance and of urgent need in developing more efficient PSCs. Here we elucidate the atomistic origin of efficient electron extraction and long stability of SnO2-based PSCs through the analysis of band alignment, carrier injection, and interfacial defects in the SnO2/MAPbI3(MA = CH3NH3+) interface using unprecedentedly high level of first-principles calculations at the PBE0 + spin-orbit-coupling + dispersion-correction level for all possible terminations and MA directions. We find that Sn-s orbital plays a crucial role in carrier injection and defect tolerance. SnO2/MAPbI3 shows favorable conduction band alignments at both MAI- and PbI2-terminations, which makes the solar cell performance of SnO2/MAPbI3 excel that of TiO2/MAPbI3. Different electron transfer mechanisms of dipole interaction and orbital hybridization at the MAI- and PbI2-terminations indicate that post-transition metal (sp valence) oxide ETLs would outperform transition metal (d valence) oxide ETLs for PSCs.},

Doping with a small amount of heterovalent metals (i.e., Bi3+, Sb3+) in CsPbI3 has been assumed to stabilize the α-phase, while here this assumption is challenged. It is demonstrated that heterovalent metal ion doping stabilizes ?-CsPbI3 at low temperatures without replacing the Pb2+ cations, while divalent cations (i.e., Ba2+, Sr2+, and Sn2+) doping stabilizes the α-CsPbI3 by replacing the Pb2+ cations. This finding is demonstrated by both theoretical and experimental results. It is also found that the divalent cations stabilize α-CsPbI3 films, making thermally stable at high temperatures, whereas heterovalent metal-doping stabilizes ?-CsPbI3 films, making metastable. The doping influence on crystal grains and the chemical composition of thin films is discussed. In particular, the charge dissociation kinetics for the Sr doped thin film are much enhanced than α-CsPbI3 and Ba doped thin films, also the initial results of the fabricated perovskite red-light-emmiting diode suggests that the Sr-doped thin films would be more suitable for the device fabrication.

In the synthesized electrocatalyst (Cu/Ru{\char64}GN), both Cu-SAs and Ru-SAs are dispersed on N-doped graphitic-matrix (GN), while other Cu-SAs are bridged to Ru nanoparticles (NPs) surface via nitrogen. It shows superior mass-activity with outstanding catalytic performance and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), outperforming commercial Pt20wt{\%}/C. Cu-SAs along with Ru-NPs enhance electric conduction or charge-transfer rate of GN-templates for fast kinetics. Owing to Cu-Ru immiscibility, the coordination of Cu-SAs by N atoms which bridge to Ru-NPs surface, introduces new active sites and brings about long-term stability (over 600 h in acidic media) by preventing aggregation of Ru-NPs.},

  title = {Prediction of a Supersolid Phase in High-Pressure Deuterium},
  abstract = {Supersolid is a mysterious and puzzling state of matter whose possible existence has stirred a vigorous debate among physicists for over 60 years. Its elusive nature stems from the coexistence of two seemingly contradicting properties, long-range order and superfluidity. We report computational evidence of a supersolid phase of deuterium under high pressure (p>800 GPa) and low temperature (T<1.0 K). In our simulations, that are based on bosonic path integral molecular dynamics, we observe a highly concerted exchange of atoms while the system preserves its crystalline order. The exchange processes are favored by the soft core interactions between deuterium atoms that form a densely packed metallic solid. At the zero temperature limit, Bose-Einstein condensation is observed as the permutation probability of N deuterium atoms approaches 1/N with a finite superfluid fraction. Our study provides concrete evidence for the existence of a supersolid phase in high-pressure deuterium and could provide insights on the future investigation of supersolid phases in real materials.},

Here, an unrevealed emission mechanism of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) APbX3 (A = Cs/CN2H5; X = Cl/Br/I) that circumvents the efficiency limit of closed-shell LEDs is explored. Though efficient emission is prohibited by optically inactive J = 0 in inversion symmetric LHPs, the anharmonicity arising from stereochemistry of Pb and resonant orbital-bonding network along the imaginary A+{\ldots}X−(T1u) transverse optical (TO) modes, breaks inversion symmetry, introducing disorder and Rashba--Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (RD-SOC). This results in bright cohelical and dark antihelical excitons. Many-body theory and first-principles calculations show that the optically active cohelical exciton is the lowest excited state in organic/inorganic LHPs. Thus, RD-SOC can drive to achieve the ideal 50\% IQE by utilizing anharmonicity, much over the 25\% IQE limitation for closed-shell LEDs.},

	abstract = {Noble nanoparticle (NP)-sized electrocatalysts have been exploited for diverse electrochemical reactions{,} in particular{,} for an eco-friendly hydrogen economy such as water splitting. Recently{,} minimal amounts of single atoms (SAs) are exploited to maximize the active surface area and to tune the catalytic activity by coordinating the SAs in defect sites of N-doped graphene (GN). For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR){,} we show high-performance 3d--5d transition metal (TM) SA catalysts using density functional theory (DFT) along with machine learning (ML)-based descriptors. We explore the stability and activity of TM--GN from the view of structure/coordination{,} formation energy{,} structural/electrochemical stability{,} electronic properties{,} electrical conductivity{,} and reaction mechanism{,} which have not been seriously explored yet. Among various --NnCm moieties{,} the --N2C2 moieties tend to be more easily formed and show higher electrochemical catalytic performance and longer durability (without aggregation/dissolution) compared with the widely studied pure --C4/C3 and --N4/N3 moieties. We found that some TM(SA)s favor a new OER/ORR mechanism{,} completely different from any known mechanism. The ML-based descriptors showing super HER/OER/ORR performances better than those of bench-mark noble metal catalysts are assessed. In the N2C2 templates{,} Ni/Ru/Rh/Pt show low HER overpotentials. Here{,} the H adsorption sites are shared by both the metal and C (not N){,} which was undiscussed in most of the previous literature where the H is attached on top of a metal atom. Low OER overpotentials are found for Pt/Ni--N2C2{,} Ni/Pd--C4{,} and Rh--N4{,} while low ORR overpotentials are found for Ir/Rh-N4{,} Pd--C4{,} Ru--N3C1 and Ni/Pd/Pt--N1C3. The present findings should help in designing high-performance SA catalysts for other various electrocatalytic reactions such as the ammonia evolution reaction.},

	Abstract = {For efficient water splitting, it is essential to develop inexpensive and super-efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report a phosphate-based electrocatalyst {$[$}Fe3Co(PO4)4{\char64}reduced-graphene-oxide(rGO){$]$} showing outstanding OER performance (much higher than state-of-the-art Ir/C catalysts), the design of which was aided by first-principles calculations. This electrocatalyst displays low overpotential (237 mV at high current density 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH), high turnover frequency (TOF: 0.54 s−1), high Faradaic efficiency (98{\%}), and long-term durability. Its remarkable performance is ascribed to the optimal free energy for OER at Fe sites and efficient mass/charge transfer. When a Fe3Co(PO4)4{\char64}rGO anodic electrode is integrated with a Pt/C cathodic electrode, the electrolyzer requires only 1.45 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2 for whole water splitting in 1 M KOH (1.39 V in 6 M KOH), which is much smaller than commercial Ir-C//Pt-C electrocatalysts. This cost-effective powerful oxygen production material with carbon-supporting substrates offers great promise for water splitting.},

	abstract = {As the race toward higher efficiency for inorganic/organic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is becoming highly competitive, a design scheme to maximize carrier transport toward higher power efficiency has been urgently demanded. In this study, a hidden role of A-site cations of PSCs in carrier transport, which has been largely neglected is unraveled, i.e., tuning the Fr{\"o}hlich electron?phonon (e?ph) coupling of longitudinal optical (LO) phonon by A-site cations. The key for steering Fr{\"o}hlich polaron is to control the interaction strength and the number of proton (or lithium) coordination to halide ions. The coordination to I? alleviates electron?phonon scattering by either decreasing the Born effective charge or absorbing the LO motion of I. This novel principle discloses low electron?phonon coupling in several promising organic cations including hydroxyl?ammonium cation (NH3OH+), hydrazinium cation (NH3NH2+) and possibly Li+ solvating methylamine (Li+∙∙∙NH2CH3), on a par with methyl?ammonium cations. A new perspective on the role of A-site cations could help in improving power efficiency and accelerating the application of PSCs.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
