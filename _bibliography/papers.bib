	abstract = {Low-temperature α-phase stabilization using HI or zwitterions in cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) endures the metastable phase properties but is thermally unstable. Doping with a small amount of heterovalent metals (i.e., Bi3+, Sb3+) in CsPbI3 has been assumed to stabilize the α-phase, while here this assumption is challenged. It is demonstrated that heterovalent metal ion doping stabilizes ?-CsPbI3 at low temperatures without replacing the Pb2+ cations, while divalent cations (i.e., Ba2+, Sr2+, and Sn2+) doping stabilizes the α-CsPbI3 by replacing the Pb2+ cations. This finding is demonstrated by both theoretical and experimental results. It is also found that the divalent cations stabilize α-CsPbI3 films, making thermally stable at high temperatures, whereas heterovalent metal-doping stabilizes ?-CsPbI3 films, making metastable. The doping influence on crystal grains and the chemical composition of thin films is discussed. In particular, the charge dissociation kinetics for the Sr doped thin film are much enhanced than α-CsPbI3 and Ba doped thin films, also the initial results of the fabricated perovskite red-light-emmiting diode suggests that the Sr-doped thin films would be more suitable for the device fabrication. These findings will guide a way for further development in thermally and air-stable optoelectronic devices.},

	Abstract = {Properties of metal elements can be modified by alloying. Given that catalytic efficiencies are often maximized using metal single-atoms (SAs), two immiscible metals can improve the catalytic activity when they can be present as non-agglomerated dual SAs. Here, we report yet-unexplored synthesis of high-performance electrocatalysts utilizing immiscibility of Cu/Ru bimetal atoms. In the synthesized electrocatalyst (Cu/Ru{\char64}GN), both Cu-SAs and Ru-SAs are dispersed on N-doped graphitic-matrix (GN), while other Cu-SAs are bridged to Ru nanoparticles (NPs) surface via nitrogen. It shows superior mass-activity with outstanding catalytic performance and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), outperforming commercial Pt20wt{\%}/C. Cu-SAs along with Ru-NPs enhance electric conduction or charge-transfer rate of GN-templates for fast kinetics. Owing to Cu-Ru immiscibility, the coordination of Cu-SAs by N atoms which bridge to Ru-NPs surface, introduces new active sites and brings about long-term stability (over 600 h in acidic media) by preventing aggregation of Ru-NPs.},

  title = {Prediction of a Supersolid Phase in High-Pressure Deuterium},
  abstract = {Supersolid is a mysterious and puzzling state of matter whose possible existence has stirred a vigorous debate among physicists for over 60 years. Its elusive nature stems from the coexistence of two seemingly contradicting properties, long-range order and superfluidity. We report computational evidence of a supersolid phase of deuterium under high pressure (p>800 GPa) and low temperature (T<1.0 K). In our simulations, that are based on bosonic path integral molecular dynamics, we observe a highly concerted exchange of atoms while the system preserves its crystalline order. The exchange processes are favored by the soft core interactions between deuterium atoms that form a densely packed metallic solid. At the zero temperature limit, Bose-Einstein condensation is observed as the permutation probability of N deuterium atoms approaches 1/N with a finite superfluid fraction. Our study provides concrete evidence for the existence of a supersolid phase in high-pressure deuterium and could provide insights on the future investigation of supersolid phases in real materials.},

	abstract = {Abstract Closed-shell light-emitting diodes (LEDs) suffer from the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) limitation imposed by optically inactive triplet excitons. Here, an unrevealed emission mechanism of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) APbX3 (A = Cs/CN2H5; X = Cl/Br/I) that circumvents the efficiency limit of closed-shell LEDs is explored. Though efficient emission is prohibited by optically inactive J = 0 in inversion symmetric LHPs, the anharmonicity arising from stereochemistry of Pb and resonant orbital-bonding network along the imaginary A+{\ldots}X−(T1u) transverse optical (TO) modes, breaks inversion symmetry, introducing disorder and Rashba--Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (RD-SOC). This results in bright cohelical and dark antihelical excitons. Many-body theory and first-principles calculations show that the optically active cohelical exciton is the lowest excited state in organic/inorganic LHPs. Thus, RD-SOC can drive to achieve the ideal 50\% IQE by utilizing anharmonicity, much over the 25\% IQE limitation for closed-shell LEDs.},

	abstract = {Noble nanoparticle (NP)-sized electrocatalysts have been exploited for diverse electrochemical reactions{,} in particular{,} for an eco-friendly hydrogen economy such as water splitting. Recently{,} minimal amounts of single atoms (SAs) are exploited to maximize the active surface area and to tune the catalytic activity by coordinating the SAs in defect sites of N-doped graphene (GN). For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR){,} we show high-performance 3d--5d transition metal (TM) SA catalysts using density functional theory (DFT) along with machine learning (ML)-based descriptors. We explore the stability and activity of TM--GN from the view of structure/coordination{,} formation energy{,} structural/electrochemical stability{,} electronic properties{,} electrical conductivity{,} and reaction mechanism{,} which have not been seriously explored yet. Among various --NnCm moieties{,} the --N2C2 moieties tend to be more easily formed and show higher electrochemical catalytic performance and longer durability (without aggregation/dissolution) compared with the widely studied pure --C4/C3 and --N4/N3 moieties. We found that some TM(SA)s favor a new OER/ORR mechanism{,} completely different from any known mechanism. The ML-based descriptors showing super HER/OER/ORR performances better than those of bench-mark noble metal catalysts are assessed. In the N2C2 templates{,} Ni/Ru/Rh/Pt show low HER overpotentials. Here{,} the H adsorption sites are shared by both the metal and C (not N){,} which was undiscussed in most of the previous literature where the H is attached on top of a metal atom. Low OER overpotentials are found for Pt/Ni--N2C2{,} Ni/Pd--C4{,} and Rh--N4{,} while low ORR overpotentials are found for Ir/Rh-N4{,} Pd--C4{,} Ru--N3C1 and Ni/Pd/Pt--N1C3. The present findings should help in designing high-performance SA catalysts for other various electrocatalytic reactions such as the ammonia evolution reaction.},

	Abstract = {For efficient water splitting, it is essential to develop inexpensive and super-efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report a phosphate-based electrocatalyst {$[$}Fe3Co(PO4)4{\char64}reduced-graphene-oxide(rGO){$]$} showing outstanding OER performance (much higher than state-of-the-art Ir/C catalysts), the design of which was aided by first-principles calculations. This electrocatalyst displays low overpotential (237 mV at high current density 100 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH), high turnover frequency (TOF: 0.54 s−1), high Faradaic efficiency (98{\%}), and long-term durability. Its remarkable performance is ascribed to the optimal free energy for OER at Fe sites and efficient mass/charge transfer. When a Fe3Co(PO4)4{\char64}rGO anodic electrode is integrated with a Pt/C cathodic electrode, the electrolyzer requires only 1.45 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2 for whole water splitting in 1 M KOH (1.39 V in 6 M KOH), which is much smaller than commercial Ir-C//Pt-C electrocatalysts. This cost-effective powerful oxygen production material with carbon-supporting substrates offers great promise for water splitting.},

	abstract = {As the race toward higher efficiency for inorganic/organic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is becoming highly competitive, a design scheme to maximize carrier transport toward higher power efficiency has been urgently demanded. In this study, a hidden role of A-site cations of PSCs in carrier transport, which has been largely neglected is unraveled, i.e., tuning the Fr{\"o}hlich electron?phonon (e?ph) coupling of longitudinal optical (LO) phonon by A-site cations. The key for steering Fr{\"o}hlich polaron is to control the interaction strength and the number of proton (or lithium) coordination to halide ions. The coordination to I? alleviates electron?phonon scattering by either decreasing the Born effective charge or absorbing the LO motion of I. This novel principle discloses low electron?phonon coupling in several promising organic cations including hydroxyl?ammonium cation (NH3OH+), hydrazinium cation (NH3NH2+) and possibly Li+ solvating methylamine (Li+∙∙∙NH2CH3), on a par with methyl?ammonium cations. A new perspective on the role of A-site cations could help in improving power efficiency and accelerating the application of PSCs.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
