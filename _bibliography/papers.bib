	abstract = {Abstract Closed-shell light-emitting diodes (LEDs) suffer from the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) limitation imposed by optically inactive triplet excitons. Here, an unrevealed emission mechanism of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) APbX3 (A = Cs/CN2H5; X = Cl/Br/I) that circumvents the efficiency limit of closed-shell LEDs is explored. Though efficient emission is prohibited by optically inactive J = 0 in inversion symmetric LHPs, the anharmonicity arising from stereochemistry of Pb and resonant orbital-bonding network along the imaginary A+{\ldots}Xâˆ’(T1u) transverse optical (TO) modes, breaks inversion symmetry, introducing disorder and Rashba--Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (RD-SOC). This results in bright cohelical and dark antihelical excitons. Many-body theory and first-principles calculations show that the optically active cohelical exciton is the lowest excited state in organic/inorganic LHPs. Thus, RD-SOC can drive to achieve the ideal 50\% IQE by utilizing anharmonicity, much over the 25\% IQE limitation for closed-shell LEDs.},

@article{D1EE00154J,
	abstract = {Noble nanoparticle (NP)-sized electrocatalysts have been exploited for diverse electrochemical reactions{,} in particular{,} for an eco-friendly hydrogen economy such as water splitting. Recently{,} minimal amounts of single atoms (SAs) are exploited to maximize the active surface area and to tune the catalytic activity by coordinating the SAs in defect sites of N-doped graphene (GN). For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR){,} we show high-performance 3d--5d transition metal (TM) SA catalysts using density functional theory (DFT) along with machine learning (ML)-based descriptors. We explore the stability and activity of TM--GN from the view of structure/coordination{,} formation energy{,} structural/electrochemical stability{,} electronic properties{,} electrical conductivity{,} and reaction mechanism{,} which have not been seriously explored yet. Among various --NnCm moieties{,} the --N2C2 moieties tend to be more easily formed and show higher electrochemical catalytic performance and longer durability (without aggregation/dissolution) compared with the widely studied pure --C4/C3 and --N4/N3 moieties. We found that some TM(SA)s favor a new OER/ORR mechanism{,} completely different from any known mechanism. The ML-based descriptors showing super HER/OER/ORR performances better than those of bench-mark noble metal catalysts are assessed. In the N2C2 templates{,} Ni/Ru/Rh/Pt show low HER overpotentials. Here{,} the H adsorption sites are shared by both the metal and C (not N){,} which was undiscussed in most of the previous literature where the H is attached on top of a metal atom. Low OER overpotentials are found for Pt/Ni--N2C2{,} Ni/Pd--C4{,} and Rh--N4{,} while low ORR overpotentials are found for Ir/Rh-N4{,} Pd--C4{,} Ru--N3C1 and Ni/Pd/Pt--N1C3. The present findings should help in designing high-performance SA catalysts for other various electrocatalytic reactions such as the ammonia evolution reaction.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
